# ***MATLAB REQUIRED + 20 GB of Disk Space*** (Artifact) Case Study: Neural Network Malware Detection Verification for Feature and Image Datasets
This artifact is used to reproduce the results shown in _Case Study: Neural Network Malware Detection Verification for Feature and Image Datasets_. 

## Installation
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory
```
git clone https://github.com/pkrobinette/verify_malware && cd verify_malware
```

2. Download the following files from [here](https://vanderbilt.box.com/s/6n18ekqikfamr2xq2uwbhs0dj1r7a1yn) into `verify_malware/archive` folder
- `bodmas.mat`
- `bodmas.npz`
- `malimg_dataset.tar.gz`

  > **NOTE:** Running `ls archive` should return the following:
- `bodmas-feature-analysis-NEW.csv`
- `bodmas.mat`
- `bodmas.npz`
- `malimg_dataset.tar.gz`
- `malimg_verification_image_paths.csv`

## Artifact Instructions (Requires ~20 GB of disk space | ~ 2 hr runtime)
Instructions to reproduce the results of the paper. **NOTE:** Results will not exactly match paper results as random seeds could be affected by docker image.

1. Make sure you are in the verify_malware directory and run the following:
```
chmod +x run_artifact.sh && ./run_artifact.sh
```

2. A MATLAB dockerfile will run first (NNV) followed by a dockerfile designated to run nnenum. A license is required for the MATLAB dockerfile. Once the dockerfile is built, you will be prompted to enter an email associated with your mathworks account. **Follow the prompted directions before leaving the artifact to run.**

  
## Results
After the artifact has finished running, all results are saved to `results/artifact`. Artifacts and corresponding paper labels are listed below:

| Artifact | Result Location | Description|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Table 5:**   | `results/artifacts/bodmas/table_5.txt` | BODMAS certified robustness accuracy + avg. time results.|
| **Table 6:**   | `results/artifacts/malimg/table_6.txt` | MALIMG certified robustness accuracy + avg. time results.|
| **Table 7:**   | `results/artifacts/malimg/table_7.txt` | MALIMG per class certified robustness accuracy results.|
| **Figure 4a:** | `results/artifacts/bodmas/figures/Fig_4a_all` | BODMAS - all features CRA results. |
| **Figure 4b:** | `results/artifacts/bodmas/figures/Fig_4b_all` | BODMAS - all features time results. |
| **Figure 5a:** | `results/artifacts/bodmas/figures/Fig_5a_continuous_discrete` | BODMAS - discrete and continuous features CRA results. |
| **Figure 5b:** |`results/artifacts/bodmas/figures/Fig_5b_continuous_discrete` | BODMAS - discrete and continuous features time results. |
| **Figure 6a:** | `results/artifacts/bodmas/figures/Fig_6a_discrete` | BODMAS - discrete features CRA results. |
| **Figure 6b:** | `results/artifacts/bodmas/figures/Fig_6b_discrete` | BODMAS - discrete features time results. |
| **Figure 7a:** | `results/artifacts/bodmas/figures/Fig_7a_continuous` | BODMAS - continuous features CRA results. |
| **Figure 7b:** | `results/artifacts/bodmas/figures/Fig_7b_continuous` | BODMAS - continuous features time results. |
| **Figure 8a:** | `results/artifacts/malimg/figures/Fig_8a` | Malimg CRA results. |
| **Figure 8b:** |  `results/artifacts/malimg/figures/Fig_8b` | Malimg time results |

## Notes
If there is not enough space to run, try:
```
docker system prune
```
